## Learn about the Global City Teams Challenge


Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) involve connecting smart devices and systems—in diverse sectors such as transportation, energy, manufacturing, and healthcare—in fundamentally new ways. These technologies will enable cities and communities to improve services, promote economic growth, and enhance the quality of life. With 54 percent of the world's population now living in cities, the development of "smart cities" and "smart communities" is becoming a major focus around the globe.


Because many of today's smart city/community development efforts are isolated and customized projects, NIST, launched the Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) to encourage collaboration and the development of standards. GCTC’s long-term goal is "to establish and demonstrate replicable, scalable, and sustainable models for incubation and deployment of interoperable, standard-based IoT solutions and demonstrate their measurable benefits in Smart Communities/Cities." To put it simply, this program will help communities benefit from the experience of others to improve efficiency and lower costs.


NIST, along with its partners, acts as a matchmaker and incubator —facilitating, advising, encouraging, nurturing, and publicizing the action clusters and their projects. Since the programs launched in September 2014, GCTC has recruited and incubated over 160 with participation from over 150 cities and 400 companies/organizations from around the world.

### Participation Guide – How to create an action cluster and exhibit/speak at the Expo


To create an action cluster, each team must complete and submit a project worksheet. The worksheet template can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nL0SuAAnfXWnFHLUdTRVpNMEE/view?usp=sharing) and a fictitious example can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nL0SuAAnfXdmhXajNmSHVZUW8/view?usp=sharing). The submitted worksheet will be reviewed and accepted once verified to meet all the requirements. Complete and email the worksheet to [gctcinfo@nist.gov](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8nL0SuAAnfXWnFHLUdTRVpNMEE/view?usp=sharing). GCTC organizers will then review the worksheet and send feedback to the team lead. The requirements to form an action cluster are as follows:
<span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span>


1. Each team (i.e. action cluster) needs to have at least 2 entities, at least one of them being a municipal government participant which will deploy the smart city solution. (At least one city official should be listed as a team member in the worksheet and participate in the team.) In most of the cases, an action cluster is composed of more than 2 entities, including multiple technology providers and sometimes multiple cities and communities.

1. Once the team is approved and registered as an action cluster, the information on the worksheet will be published on the GCTC web site, either in summary or in full. The contact information of the team lead will be made public, but the contact information of the municipal partner will not be made public.

1. At the GCTC Expo, it is highly encouraged that the municipal government partner participates in the team presentation and exhibit. Each team should demonstrate the feasibility of their project at the Expo by exhibiting prototypes, pilots, and/or preliminary results. The priorities of speaking opportunities will be given to the action clusters joined by one or more municipal partners. Note that the action clusters with no municipal participation at the Expo may not receive a speaking opportunity depending on the level of demand.

1. Optional: Teams are encouraged to have multiple municipal partners and technology providers in an action cluster.


The [GCTC 2017 Expo](https://pages.nist.gov/GCTC/event/gctc-expo-2017/) will be the largest smart city event hosted by the US federal government. The opportunity to exhibit and speak at the GCTC Expo is offered to the registered action clusters. Here are a few important points on the participation of action clusters.


1. Each action cluster is offered an exhibit space free of charge (8x8 or 10x10, exact size TBD). (Note that the space is provided free of charge, but you will need to cover the cost to build your booth. Details will be provided to the team lead.)

1. Each action cluster is eligible for a speaking slot. If there is excessive demand, priority will be given to the action clusters that are joined by city official(s) as part of the presentation and the exhibit.

1. The event has no registration fee and open to all registered attendees. Participating action clusters should encourage as many of their contacts to attend the Expo as possible.

1. Limited travel support will be made available to city officials speaking as a member of action cluster or SuperCluster up to a ceiling (exact amount TBD) and will be offered to one city official per action cluster.

In this year’s Expo, several SuperClusters will be highlighted as well as action clusters. For those who are not familiar with SuperClusters, they are alliances of action clusters and relevant additional stakeholders based on sectors. Currently, there are five official SuperClusters (1) transportation (2) city data platform (3) public safety (4) energy/water/waste (5) public WiFi and two SuperClusters under construction (Healthcare and Data Governance). Each SuperCluster will be given a dedicated exhibit space and plenary speaking slots. With the given exhibit space, each action cluster has a choice to set up their own booth, join their space with a SuperCluster of choice, or do both. If you feel that your action cluster is closely aligned with a SuperCluster and want to join your exhibit space with a specific SuperCluster, please reach out to the SuperCluster chairs (The contact info of the chairs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a697VZZElvLgYISq0ukHhLsK556HQPcdIt_IG6gTPfM/edit?usp=sharing).)
